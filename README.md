Welcome to the XSS WAF Bypass Techniques ! This repository is a curated collection of advanced payloads, techniques, and tricks to bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) when exploiting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This guide is intended for penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, and ethical hackers who want to stay ahead of the game.

**What You'll Find Here**

This repository contains a variety of payloads and methods designed to bypass common WAFs, including but not limited to:

  Redirection Payloads: Techniques to manipulate document.location and window.location for effective redirection attacks.
  
  Cookie Stealing Payloads: Methods to extract cookies from unsuspecting users.
  JavaScript Execution Tricks: Various techniques to obfuscate JavaScript code and execute it despite WAF protections.
  HTML Entity and Unicode Obfuscation: Using HTML entities and Unicode to craft payloads that evade standard detection mechanisms.
  Concatenation and Encoding Techniques: Combining strings and encoding payloads to slip past pattern-based filters.

**Why Use This Repository?**

Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are an essential defense layer for web applications, but they are not invincible. This repository aims to:

  Provide educational content for ethical hacking and security research.
  Help security professionals understand how attackers bypass WAF protections.
  Enable developers and cybersecurity experts to strengthen their defenses by learning how common attacks evade detection.

**Disclaimer**

Warning: The payloads and techniques provided in this repository are for educational and ethical purposes only.
